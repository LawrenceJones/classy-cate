# CATe API

The API built on top of Imperial College's CATe VLE system.

# Group Authentication

## Login [/authenticate]
CATe API makes use of JSON WebTokens to make requests on behalf of users to the underlying CATe/DoC services.

The basic setup requries an initial authorization request, where the user supplies their college login and password.

Credentials are then encrypted to generate a token string, which is passed back to the client on a 200 response.

Any requests to routes prefixed with `/api` must then include the token in the HTTP `Authorization` header.

Example header. `Authorization: Bearer TOKEN`
